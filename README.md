# RL_Assignment
Acknowledgments

This work relies heavily on the source code and data accompanying the "Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps with Contextual Bandits" paper published at RecSys 2020. Their original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/deezer/carousel_bandits).

The code comes with a small working dataset for user_features just to give an general idea how the code works. However, the code cannot function properly without the original dataset (different user types from different segments). You can find the original dataset (1.8 GB file) [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4048678#.X22w4pMza3J)
